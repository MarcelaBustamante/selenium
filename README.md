Hereâ€™s a draft README file for the `selenium` repository based on the current context:

# Selenium Project

This repository contains a project built using **Selenium**, a powerful tool for web browser automation. The project is written entirely in **Java** and demonstrates various use cases and implementations of Selenium for web testing and automation.

## Features

- **Web Automation:** Automate web browsers to perform tasks like form submissions, data scraping, and navigation.
- **Test Automation:** Includes examples of automated test cases for web applications.
- **Cross-Browser Support:** Demonstrates how to run tests across multiple browsers.
- **Page Object Model (POM):** Leverages the POM design pattern for maintainable and scalable test scripts.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Maven or Gradle (optional but recommended)
- Web browsers and corresponding WebDriver executables (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MarcelaBustamante/selenium.git
   cd selenium
   ```

2. **Set up the environment:**
   - Download and install the required WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome).
   - Ensure the WebDriver executable is in your system's PATH or configure it in your project.

3. **Run the tests:**

   Or, if you are using Gradle:
   ```bash
   gradle test
   ```

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java`: Contains the main Java code for the project.
